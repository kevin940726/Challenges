The goal of this project is to provide challenges for developers to practice on working with OSS. The challengers can practice on making changes by taking either hypothetical or practical challenges, the reviewers can practice on reviewing changes and proposing challenges. It’s like a RPG game for OSS developers.

## Characters

Like every RPG games, there are characters. There are 3 kinds of characters in this repo:

- 👨‍🏫 **Reviewer**: submits challenges and reviews the PRs.
- 👨‍💻 **Challenger**: takes the challenges and submits PRs.
- 👷 **Maintainer**: reviews the challenges and maintains this repo.

## General guideline

1. The goal of a challenge is to provide opportunities for **reviewers** and **challengers** to practice on working with OSS.
2. A challenge can be feature requests, bug reports, performance optimizations, or mixed combinations, just like in regular OSS.
3. A challenge doesn’t have to have answers upfront, it’s okay to submit unsolved challenges.
4. A challenge can only be assigned to one **challenger** at the same time. **Reviewers** can re-assign challengers if the original challenger doesn’t work on it anymore.
5. There’s no strict timeline nor deadlines for any challenge, take your time and be patient. However, it’s often more rewarding to provide feedbacks as soon as possible, either for **reviewers** or **challengers**.
6. All the code submitted will be licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE). Also be sure to follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Taking a challenge 👨‍💻

1. Go to the [open challenges list](https://github.com/kevin940726/challenges/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Athinking%3A+++challenges%22+-label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%AA++challenge+accepted%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to find an open challenge you like to work on.
2. Leave a comment on the challenge to wait for the **reviewer** to assign the challenge to you.
3. Start working on the challenge, happy coding 👨‍💻!
4. If the challenge has a starter folder then make changes in it, if not then create a new folder under `challenges` and named it `your-challenge-name` (kebab-case). It's recommended to make your starter runnable in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), so that the reviewers can review them _live_.
5. Submit a pull request (PR) based on the template when you’re done. Be sure to give a detailed explanation on what you’ve done to make it more likely to get approved and merged.
6. Go back to 1. and find another challenge!

## Submitting a challenge 👨‍🏫

1. Submit a challenge via the [template](https://github.com/kevin940726/challenges/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Athinking%3A+++challenges&template=propose-challenge.md&title=%5BChallenge%5D). Be sure to make the challenge as clear as possible.
2. Wait for the **maintainers** to attach necessary labels.
3. _(Recommended)_ Submit a PR to include a _starter_ for the challengers to work on. Place your starter inside a folder named `your-challenge-name` (kebab-case) and place it under the `challenges` directory. It's also recommended to make your starter runnable in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), so that we can review them _live_.
4. Review the submitted PRs from the **challengers**. Be kind and give feedbacks to help them got merged, but also be sure to request changes when needed.
5. Close the challenge issue if it’s not yet closed by the PR.
6. Work on submitting other challenges! Or try being a **challenger** next time!

## FAQ

> Can I work on improving already solved challenges?

Sure! Any kinds of improvements are welcome, your enhancements will be reviewed by the same reviewer. Often time, there’s no need to create another challenge for the improvement, but if you feel like it’s clearer then go ahead.

> How big or what scale should the challenge be?

It’s up to you. However, small challenges will get a better chance to get challengers to work on. You can split up the challenges into multiple smaller ones if you feel like to.

> Can I take my own challenges?

Sure, if you find something you like to work on, and also want to gather some feedbacks from the community, there's no reason not to.

> Who can review a challenge, is it only reviewers?

No. Everyone can review a challenge. Just that the reviewers might know something more about the challenge and have the final permission to accept the changes or reject them.

> My challenge is taken, can I still work on it?

If the challenge is already taken to someone else, then in general we should give the taker a chance to implement it. However, nothing is stopping you from taking the challenge offline as a practice. A better idea would be to communicate with the taker and work on the challenge together, or be a reviewer and give feedbacks.
